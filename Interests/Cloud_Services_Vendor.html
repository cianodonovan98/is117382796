         <p align="center">Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon.com that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis.<br />
         The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a full-fledged virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the Internet.
         The browser acts as a window into the virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. 
         They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services for their own and their customers' benefit.
